Deep Learning Tools for Biologic Design.

While tools like DeepChem provide powerful open source tools for designing small molecule based drugs, there aren't strong open source tools available for designing biologics. In part, this situation is due to the powerful experimental systems available for biologics which enable experimentalists to make significant progress without having to rely on computational tools.

Nevertheless, we believe that there is strong room to improve the open source tooling in this area, and we are open to suggestions for doing so. Please raise issues with suggestions!
